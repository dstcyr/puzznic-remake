# PUZZNIC

![puzznic](puzznic.png)

With this project, I wanted to recreate a classic game from scratch using only C++ and SDL. I used an emulator and grabbed the graphics and sounds from memory (and I added some touch using Aseprite). I was once addicted to this game on the NES, and I coded the rules from what I remembered and with some help from Wikipedia. For me, coding this project is a hobby, a sort of kata, or a way to prove to myself that I can code games without having to look at tutorials, big commercial engines, or YouTube videos.



## HOW TO PLAY

The controls are the same as the defaults used on most emulators for NES controllers.



**LEFT and RIGHT arrows** : move the selected block.

**X** : Grab blocks to move them

**ENTER :** start the game



## BUILD

If you would like to see the end result before having a look at the code, I've included a build in the release section. Download the zip file and double-click the exe file.
